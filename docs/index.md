<p>An auditor asks: <em>was Maria trained for the Harbor site on the day she started there?</em> In a typical stack, the evidence is spread across systems that never shared an identity model or a clock.</p>

<p>Maria is trained for Harbor from March 1 to June 1 and placed there on March 2 under release <code>hr-2026.1</code>. The rules then change: <code>hr-2026.2</code> requires a supervisor on every placement. Later, an auditor finds that the certificate actually began on March 5.</p>

<p>Triplex runs inside your process as Effect layers. Switching storage changes the layer you provide, and the rest of the program stays the same. On PostgreSQL, Triplex can share your application’s transaction, so your own rows, Triplex facts, the journal, and an outbox row commit or roll back together.</p>

<div>
<h3>Good fit</h3>
<p>Compliance and onboarding, eligibility and entitlements, policy engines, case management, and back-office workflows. Any domain where “as of when?” and “under which rules?” come up regularly. Also agent-driven systems that need a durable world model with an attributed record of every change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Not a fit</h3>
<p>High-volume telemetry, blob storage, caches, and queues. Also workloads that only need a relational table and never ask about history or provenance. Triplex is a system of record for facts, not a replacement for every table.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How it relates</h3>
<p><a href="/datomic">Datomic</a> offers facts, Datalog, and historical database views. <a href="/xtdb">Current XTDB</a> offers bitemporal data through SQL and XTQL. Triplex embeds in TypeScript and connects facts to versioned rules and reconciled work. <strong>Event sourcing</strong> gives you history, but you hand-write every projection. <strong>Workflow engines</strong> run durable code; Triplex decides what work should exist, and the two compose.</p>
